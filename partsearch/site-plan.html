      <p>Many maintenance departments use SAP as their system of record for spare parts. SAP is not very user friendly or efficient for locating the parts. The purpose of this website is to make that easier.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        Every machine in a manufacturing facility has a very special number. This number represents how much money it costs for every minute or hour the machine is down. When the machine breaks, it takes time to realize it is broken. It also takes time for maintenance to be called, for them to arrive and time to diagnose the problem. When the problem is identified and a part is needed, how long does it take to find the correct part. ARB Part Search is designed to find the part you need as fast as possible so your machine can be back up and running.
        In addition to its great time savings, ARB Part Search also helps your mechanics and parts room attendant find the CORRECT part. If money is lost in a single downtime event, what is the revenue loss for several downtime events cause by using the incorrect part. For example, a machine is down for a bad power supply, but it is replaced by an incorrect power supply. Then, for days or weeks, the machine is stopping on a regular basis because of blown fuses.

      <h3>Search Page</h3>
      <p>
        The Text Search is often the first and most common path to finding a part. For example, a mechanic may come to the parts window with a bearing with the part number clearly etched on it. In this case, the parts attendant simply types the part number into the text search box. The results will then be displayed in the table along with bin locations and stock levels.
        When Text Search comes up short or yields too many results, it can be helpful to narrow it down to the machine that the part is needed for. For this, we use the Location Tree. When the plant keeps good records of what part is used where, you can utilize all that hard work. Simply select the location where the part you are looking for is used. You can be as broad or specific as necessary in your selection.
        Another quick way to narrow down your search is the ability to filter your results by the manufacturer. For that, we use the Manufacturer List. If the motor you want is a Baldor, you don’t need to waste time searching through all the other brands for what you want. You can select the brand for the list and only those parts will appear in the results.
        Whichever methods you use to search for your part, it is made much easier when you can see pictures of the possible matches in the Picture Preview. It can save a lot of physical searching and confirming if you can see a picture of a possible match, realize that is not it, and keep scrolling without having to leave your desk or station.

      <h3>Details Page</h3>
      <p>
        When you want to find confirmation that you have found the correct part, it can help to check the Location List. For example, if you are looking for a gasket for an apple pie oven, its appearance on the list of parts for that pie oven is a dead giveaway. It is also helpful to know about other machines that use that same part such as the cherry or blueberry pie ovens.
        Another good indication that you are onto the correct part is the History List. In this list, you can see the other machine the part was checked out to and the work order description.  Imagine looking in this window and seeing a part used for the exact same problem that you are trying to solve.
